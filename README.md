this is a work in progress engine that aims to
    - define player-npc interactions using dialogue trees and story conditionals
    - define a runtime-generated conlang with which the player can interact
    - create a small ui engine to support gameplay
    - allow for text-adventure style gameplay in interconnect spaces with descriptions, locations, people, and items
